This project is my attempt to understand the building blocks of a computer. 

I am a software developer with 8 years of industry experiece, predominently in bigdata space. Still, computer is a black box to me. I hope this cousera project will shread some lights to that black box.

I am taking this course in Cousera: https://www.nand2tetris.org/
