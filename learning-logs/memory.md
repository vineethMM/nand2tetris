* Memory chips.
   Here, we introduce the discrete time concept (rather than considering time as continuous). This is important to abstract way the delays in propagating the voltage in physical implementation. Basic unit of time is one clock cycle. Memory chips are nothing but circuits that can `remember` high/low voltage over discrete time. They are called sequential chips.
* Once we designed a a `bit` storage, same can be leveraged to create 16 bit memory register. 16 here forms the word length of the Hack computer. Word is the unit of information that can be
  addressed and moved at a time.
