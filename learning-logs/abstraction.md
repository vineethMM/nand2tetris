# Abstraction
It turns out to me that the idea of abstraction seems to be most important one in computer science. It is everywhere in computer science. Right from the 0s and 1s. They are nothing but an abstraction that is given to the actual physical voltage levels (high and low voltage levels). With zeros and ones we are abstracting all underlaying physical implementation details of a computer. It helps think afresh from 0s and 1s, avoiding all the clutters of physical implementation.

Abstraction helps to decouple and encapsulate complexities within systems.

On the first level, it is zeros and one.
We build logic gates, memory chips, ALU on the grounds of 0s and 1s. But as we go along, we figured out that to think and write meaningful programs in the world of 0s and 1s is extremely difficult, or in other words, we tend to get lost in complex world of 0s and 1s. Thats the best time for our next abstraction, the Machine language.
